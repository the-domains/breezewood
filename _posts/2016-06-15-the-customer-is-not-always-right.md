  This business is too challenging for any one client to have all the answers.
  If we let you believe this, at best you'll have diminished performance. More
  likely however, is some outcome with an element of failure. We aim to avoid
  that at all costs.  There are many moving parts and steps in the production
  cycle that come together to form your finished product, many of which are in
  the background that you'd typically not concern yourself with or could not be
  expected to have complete command over.  You may have the experience on many
  fronts to dictate exactly how your product should be made. But chances are
  there are opportunities for improvement if you leave yourself open to that.
